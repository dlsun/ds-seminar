## Readings

## Fall 2022

The theme of the readings for Fall 2022 is **the past**.

### Week 1: September 21

### Week 2: September 28

Hypothesis testing is a core part of many statistics classes. But where did the ideas such as the p-value, Type I error, and power come from? This reading reviews the turbulent history of hypothesis testing in the 20th century.

#### Required Reading:

- [Chapters 10 and 11](http://dlsun.github.io/ds-seminar/readings/LadyTastingTea-HypothesisTesting.pdf) from David Salsburg (2001). _The lady tasting tea: How statistics revolutionized science in the twentieth century_. Macmillan.

#### Additional Resources:

- Erich Lehmann (1993). [The Fisher, Neyman-Pearson Theories of Testing Hypotheses: One Theory or Two?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2291263). (You should be able to download a PDF when you are on the Cal Poly network or VPN.)
- Erich Lehmann (2011). [Fisher, Neyman, and the Creation of Classical Statistics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9500-1).
- [Oral History Interviews with David Blackwell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo_YYxsFF6Y&list=PLCwE4GdJdVRIU1j2-nzpxOIi3XSNEZ3qv) (Youtube playlist).

#### Assignment:

In your assigned group of 6 students:
- Pair 1 should prepare slides discussing Fisher's contributions to hypothesis testing.
- Pair 2 should prepare slides discussing Neyman's (and Pearson's) contributions to hypothesis testing.
- Pair 3 should prepare slides comparing and contrasting the two approaches.

### Week 3: October 5

In the early to mid 1900s, the field of eugenics - the idea that some groups or people are inherently genetically inferior - was a mainstream and well-respected scientific pursuit.  Many of the foundational ideas of classic statistics were developed in conjunction with eugenics applications.  In the modern era, now that these ideas have been rejected as racist/classist/etc, how should we regard the influential people and ideas that came out of that movement?

#### Required Reading:

- [This twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1268392721275744256.html) by famous statistician Daniela Witten, which initiated a change to a major statistics award.
- [Scientific Priestcraft](https://github.com/dlsun/ds-seminar/blob/master/readings/Superior_Ch3.pdf), Chapter 3 of "Superior: The Return of Race Science" by Ruha Benjamin.

#### Assignment:

We ask you to think carefully about the practice of re-contextualizing scientific contributions in light of modern ethics.  Questions to consider:

- Does removing accolates like the Fisher Prize harm the target and/or his family?  Should the scientific contributions be considered in isolation, and honored, regardless of what else the individual did?
- Does this approach truly create a more welcoming/diverse scientific community?  Or does it discourage or hinder others from contributing to scientific progress, for fear of personal scrutiny?
- Does it remove objectivity from statistical methodology?
- Does it help us prevent similar mistakes in the future?

In your assigned group of 6 students:
- Pair 1 should track down more examples of events like the Fisher Prize renaming: Can you find historical figures related to data science whose ethics are currently in question?  Can you find examples of honors or accolades being removed from these people (or discussions suggesting such)? 
- Pair 2 should collect, summarize, and present arguments **against** re-contextualizing scientific contributions in light of modern ethics.     
- Pair 3 should collect, summarize, and present arguments **for** re-contextualizing scientific contributions in light of modern ethics.
