## Readings

The theme of the readings for Fall 2021 is **the past**.

### Week 1: September 22

### Week 2: September 29

Hypothesis testing is a core part of many statistics classes. But where did the ideas such as the p-value, Type I error, and power come from? This reading reviews the turbulent history of hypothesis testing in the 20th century.

#### Required Reading:

- [Chapters 10 and 11](http://dlsun.github.io/ds-seminar/readings/LadyTastingTea-HypothesisTesting.pdf) from David Salsburg (2001). _The lady tasting tea: How statistics revolutionized science in the twentieth century_. Macmillan.

#### Additional Resources:

- Erich Lehmann (1993). [The Fisher, Neyman-Pearson Theories of Testing Hypotheses: One Theory or Two?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2291263). (You should be able to download a PDF when you are on the Cal Poly network or VPN.)
- Erich Lehmann (2011). [Fisher, Neyman, and the Creation of Classical Statistics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9500-1).
- [Oral History Interviews with David Blackwell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo_YYxsFF6Y&list=PLCwE4GdJdVRIU1j2-nzpxOIi3XSNEZ3qv) (Youtube playlist).

#### Assignment:

In your assigned group of 6 students:
- Pair 1 should prepare slides discussing Fisher's contributions to hypothesis testing.
- Pair 2 should prepare slides discussing Neyman's (and Pearson's) contributions to hypothesis testing.
- Pair 3 should prepare slides comparing and contrasting the two approaches.


## Week 3: October 6

In the early to mid 1900s, the field of eugenics - the idea that some groups or people are inherently genetically inferior - was a mainstream and well-respected scientific pursuit.  Many of the foundational ideas of classic statistics were developed in conjunction with eugenics applications.  In the modern era, now that these ideas have been rejected as racist/classist/etc, how should we regard the influential people and ideas that came out of that movement?

#### Required Reading:

- [This twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1268392721275744256.html) by famous statistician Daniela Witten, which initiated a change to a major statistics award.
- [Scientific Priestcraft](https://github.com/dlsun/ds-seminar/blob/master/readings/Superior_Ch3.pdf), Chapter 3 of "Superior: The Return of Race Science" by Ruha Benjamin.

#### Assignment:

We ask you to think carefully about the practice of re-contextualizing scientific contributions in light of modern ethics.  Questions to consider:

- Does removing accolates like the Fisher Prize harm the target and/or his family?  Should the scientific contributions be considered in isolation, and honored, regardless of what else the individual did?
- Does this approach truly create a more welcoming/diverse scientific community?  Or does it discourage or hinder others from contributing to scientific progress, for fear of personal scrutiny?
- Does it remove objectivity from statistical methodology?
- Does it help us prevent similar mistakes in the future?

In your assigned group of 6 students:
- Pair 1 should track down more examples of events like the Fisher Prize renaming: Can you find historical figures related to data science whose ethics are currently in question?  Can you find examples of honors or accolades being removed from these people (or discussions suggesting such)? 
- Pair 2 should collect, summarize, and present arguments **against** re-contextualizing scientific contributions in light of modern ethics.     
- Pair 3 should collect, summarize, and present arguments **for** re-contextualizing scientific contributions in light of modern ethics.

## Week 4: October 13

We will look at the Frequentist vs. Bayes debate! Not only does this debate pertain to how you think and do your statistics and data science, but also to some of your ways of thinking every day! Please come prepared to defend both, although we want you will be asked to take a side in class.

#### Required Reading:

- New York Times Article: [The Odds, Continually Updated](readings/The%20Odds,%20Continually%20Updated%20-%20The%20New%20York%20Times.pdf)
- [Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches in Statistics](https://www.probabilisticworld.com/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics)
- Efron, B. (2005). [Bayesians, frequentists, and scientists](https://dlsun.github.io/ds-seminar/readings/Bayesians,%20Frequentists,%20and%20Scientists.pdf). _Journal of the American Statistical Association_, 100(469), 1-5.
- [The Boxer, the Wrestler, and the Coin Flip: A Paradox of Robust Bayesian Inference and Belief Functions](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/augie4.pdf) Andrew Gelman, The American Statistician, May 2006, Vol. 60, No. 2
- xkcd comic on [Frequentists vs. Bayesians](https://xkcd.com/1132/)

Here are some additional readings that might be of interest.

- MIT Lecture Notes: [Comparison of frequentist and Bayesian inference](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading20.pdf).
- Efron, B. (1986). [Why isn't everyone a Bayesian?](https://dlsun.github.io/ds-seminar/readings/Why%20Isn't%20Everyone%20a%20Bayesian.pdf) _The American Statistician_, 40(1), 1-5.
- Andrew Gelman's blog post: [Why I Don't Like Bayesian Statistics](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/04/01/problems_with_b/). (This is an April Fools' Joke written by a famous Bayesian statistician. However, it contains some good ideas.)

#### Assignment:

We ask you to think carefully about these two sides: Frequentist and Bayes.  Questions to consider:

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?
- Is it possible be a little bit of both? Why or why not?
- Think about your own beliefs about how probability and the likelihood of events work. In your day-to-day life (when not doing statistics or data science), do you tend to be more frequentist or bayesian? 

In your assigned group of 6 students:
- Pair 1 should organize and present the strengths of the Frequentist side and the weaknesses of the Bayesian side, as they pertain to statistics and data science work.
- Pair 2 should organize and present the strengths of the Bayesian side and the weaknesses of the Frequentist side, as they pertain to statistics and data science work.     
- Pair 3 should comment on how these two sides pertain to day-to-day life, and whether your position on them in this context should be related to your position on them in the context of your work. Be sure to think carefully and thoroughly here. Your comments might also include similarities between the two sides in certain situations.   

## Week 5: October 20

We will read a classic paper by Leo Breiman entitled "Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures."   The PDF linked below also contains comments by leading statisticians and data scientists which will give you more ideas as you prepare your presentations.

#### Required Reading:

- Leo Breiman: [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author)](readings/breiman.pdf)

This paper by Efron can be seen as an update to Breiman's paper 20 years later -- it is not required reading but might be interesting for you to read over:

- Efron, B. (2020). [Prediction, Estimation, and Attribution](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1762613) _Journal of the American Statistical Association_.

#### Assignment:

In your assigned group of 6 students:
- Pair 1 should organize and present the strengths of the "data modeling" culture.
- Pair 2 should organize and present the strengths of the "algorithmic modeling" culture.
- Pair 3 should compare and constrast the two cultures.


## Week 6: October 27

We will discuss the past and future of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

#### Required Reading:

- [Deep Learning's Diminish Returns](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost)
- [Probability of an Approaching AI Winter](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-of-an-approaching-ai-winter-c2d818fb338a)


#### Assignment:

In your assigned group of 6 students: 
- Pair 1 should review the two papers
- Pair 2 should make the argument why AI is the best thing since peanut butter and jelly and why investment in AI will keep growing
- Pair 3 should make the argument that history will repeat itself, reality will crush expectations, and we will head for another AI winter
